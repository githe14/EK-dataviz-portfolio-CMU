# Final Project: Part 2

## Project Pivots & The New Proposal
Before we dive deeper in developing the narrative of the project for Part II, including the wireframe and user research, I would like to share the major updates I've made in my project scope based on my initial data exploration and feedback from Part I. 

### Recap of Part I - Idea A: From Vinyl to Viral
In my initial project proposal, I wanted to explore the trend of music consumption over time based on the **Music Industry Sales from RIAA (Recording Industry Association of America)**, accessed via [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/music-sales). This dataset provides a comprehensive historical record of revenue and unit volumes by media format from 1973 to 2019.

As a rough outline, I planned to analyze over 13,000 data points in this set and visualize the trend that reflects the "Format Wars" in the music industry over the last 50 years. My goal was to deliver a core narrative centered on the industry's unsettling journey from the **Era of Ownership** (physical sales, such as vinyl and CDs) through the **Age of Digital Disruption** (piracy and downloads) to the modern **Era of Platform Wars** (digital streaming platforms). As a data visualization project aimed to be exploratory, I found the general music consumer to be the key target audience to demonstrate how their listening behavior, along with that of millions of others, influenced the industry to change its entire business model.

For my initial visualization sketch, shown below, I used a stacked area chart to represent the shifts in music revenue. The visualization highlighted the magnitude of physical sales until its collapse, followed by a brief boom in piracy/downloads and the emergence of digital streaming platforms.

### Why am I Pivoting Project Proposal?

The reason is that the initial idea was too broad in terms of topic, and doesn't provide much insight or a story that the readers/users can take away from the project. It lacks a meaningful "call to action" that prompts readers to feel they have learned something and leaves them with a clear next step. Moreover, I'm heavily relying on a single resource and dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/music-sales?resource=download) I found for IDEA A. This doesn't provide in-depth context. Thus, further contextualizing my story with more resources and data was needed. Overall, IDEA A is a solid topic to set the stage by narrating the shift from "Physical" to "Streaming" using Music Industry Sales data, but it presents an overly broad macro-level analysis.




## Wireframes / storyboards
> Using your sketches developed last week, further develop your story outline and relevant components visually through the use of wireframing / storyboards. Using your outline as a guide, include high-fidelity, individual draft data visualizations of the critical elements of your story you want to share with your reader. Note: you can build these elements out directly in Shorthand this week if you wish.  Reminder: this template is intended to help, but it doesn't substitute for reading through the full homework assignment!  The assignment page on Canvas includes many important details for completing Part II of the final project.
