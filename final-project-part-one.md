# Final Project: Part 1

This is the first stage of my final project. I will be exploring publicly accessible datasets related to music sales, the sales medium, or any relevant data sources related to performance/sales in the sector, as it is one of my research fields of interest. As of now, I aim for this data visualization project to be exploratory, meaning it will not have any predetermined conclusions. Instead, I will analyze the data, identify any patterns or unique/interesting features, and build the best-fitting data visualization that conveys the key stories I want to deliver to the readers. I hope this project will be more interactive with readers and collaborate on each insight rather than delivering a single, definitive conclusion.

** Please note that this project may not accurately represent the entire industry, as publicly accessible sources for the music industry are more limited compared to other industries. ** 

## IDEA A: From Vinyl to Viral

### Outline 
The music industry has undergone more radical business model transformations in the last 50 years than almost any other sector. This project will explore the economic "Format Wars," tracing the industry's journey from the physical ownership era (Vinyl, Cassette, CD) through the digital disruption crisis (Downloads, Piracy) to the modern access-based model (Streaming).

As someone interested in the strategic side of the business, I’ve always been fascinated by the "value gap" that occurred between 2000 and 2015. We often hear that streaming "saved" the industry, but the raw numbers tell a more complex story about inflation, devaluation, and the fight to convince consumers to pay for something they have grown accustomed to receiving for free. My project will trace this financial rollercoaster, analyzing how the industry essentially had to break its own business model to survive the digital age. The goal is to visualize not just sales figures, but the changing value of music itself over the last four decades.

If the data and visualization can serve as a music industry strategy, I would like to see inflation-adjusted revenue figures rather than raw numbers, so that the project can help us understand the real loss of value during the digital crash relative to the CD era.

Although it's not limited, the primary target audiences will be the general music consumer. I want to see how my own consumption habits (buying CDs vs. streaming) aggregate with millions of others to force the industry to change its entire business model.

Based on the initial story, context, and the target, the project structure of IDEA A can follow: 

1. The Setup: The story starts in the late 90s. I will visualize the sheer magnitude of CD revenue when it was at its peak. The goal here is to establish the Old World context: a model built on scarcity and bundling, which forces people to buy the entire album. 
2. The Conflict: The inciting incident is the arrival and boom of the MP3 players and online downloads. I can demonstrate how the unbundling of the album into one-dollar singles led to a separation of revenue from consumption. Even if people were listening to more music, the industry was making significantly less money. This part of the story highlights the conflicts between disruptive technology and legacy business models in the old days.
3. The Climax: This is the low point of the story that data seems to show in my rough analysis. From 2010 to 2014, physical sales had collapsed, but digital downloads weren't generating enough revenue to fill that hole. I want the readers to see that gap/hole visually. For instance, the story can reveal the billions of dollars that vanished from the market because the industry hadn't yet figured out how to monetize access.
4. The Resolution: The story concludes with the rapid rise of paid streaming, such as Spotify and Apple Music. The curve turns upward, but the takeaway is nuanced. The market regained its growth, and in fact, it gained momentum more than at any other time. Yet, it's no longer selling products, but almost feels like selling utility, technology, and service. The story can conclude by asking whether this new model is sustainable or if we are merely renting our culture.

### Initial sketches

Sketch 1: Music Industry Revenue by Format (1973–2019)

This visualization concept captures the structural shifts in the music business over the five decades. The stacked area format enables us to visualize the dominance of physical media during the CD boom, the rise of the digital download model, and the eventual shift to the mega streaming era as the industry’s primary revenue source. Key notes that can be included in the later version can include the CD peak and the point where streaming surpasses the 50% mark, which I see as the story's pivotal moments. This sketch can be used as a narrative to illustrate how consumers' trends/behavior forced a complete shift of the business model in the music industry.

Sketch 2: U.S. Recorded Music Revenue (Inflation-Adjusted)

This chart provides a macro view of the overall music revenue in the data set, presented in a more intuitive and traditional design. The industry’s financial trajectory in real dollars. It highlights the dramatic increase from the late-1990s peak, the collapse during the digital disruption years, and the subsequent recovery driven by streaming. Moreover, by using inflation-adjusted values, the sketch effectively highlights the true scale of the value gap and provides context for it. Although this visualization is rough and needs to be more detailed, it can serve as the backbone for the project's narrative.

### The data

The primary source of the analysis will be based on RIAA (Recording Industry Association of America) data. 
The source is found via Kaggle, called "Music Industry Sales (1973 - 2019)".

### Method and Medium

For the initial brainstorming stage, including Part One, we will primarily use rough sketches on paper (shorthand). Then, as I finalize the main context/story and clean the dataset to my key message, I will explore different visualization options using a few online tools that are interactive and easy to use, such as Datawrapper (https://datawraper.de/) or Flourish (https://flourish.studio/). For the final visualization, I plan to use Tableau as my main tool. I chose Tableau for its features to effectively handle time-series data on music sales, and its interactive features (tooltips, filtering, etc.) will allow the audience to explore specific formats without cluttering the main narrative. However, other online tools might be used in conjunction with or as an alternative to Tableau.
