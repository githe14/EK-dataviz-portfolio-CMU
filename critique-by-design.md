# The Shift to Digital: Redesigning U.S. Ad Spend Visualization

_For each step below, you should document your progress as you move forward.  In terms of tone, think of the writeup as though you're keeping journal of your step-by-step process.   You should include a any insights you gained from the critique method, and what it led you to think about when considering the redesign.  You should talk about how you moved next to the sketches, and any insights you gleaned from your user feedback.  Document what you changed based on the user feedback in your redesign.  Finally, talk about what your redesigned data visualization shows, why you selected the data visualization you did, and what you attempted to show or do differently._

_You can include screenshots, sketches or other artifacts with your narrative to help tell the story of how you moved through the process.  Again, make sure to avoid including any personally identifying information about your interviewees (don't list full names, etc.).  While this template serves as a guide, make sure to reference the assignment writeup on Canvas for the official guidance.  This template does not include all guidance mentioned on the assignment page._

## Step one: the visualization

Here is the original data visualization, along with its source.

### Why did I choose this particular data visualization?

I selected this visualization from Visual Capitalist because it depicts a massive, historical shift in the advertising industry—the overtaking of traditional media by the internet—yet the visual execution felt cluttered and slightly overwhelming. The dataset itself is powerful, showing a clear "crossing of the paths" between internet and television spending around 2016, but the use of a multi-line chart with numerous variables makes it difficult to instantly grasp the magnitude of the change between the starting point (2012) and the projection (2024).

## Step two: the critique

Overall, my observation of this line graph is that this is a data-driven, declarative visualization. It is not conceptual but is instead supported by statistics, with a clear focus on informing the audience about data and making a statement about its findings.

What worked really well was the chart's simplicity in conveying its main point. The title is straightforward and concise, and the visualization immediately shows the high-level contrast between 2012 and 2024 using the height changes of each line. I also thought it was good that the chart was able to fit all the variables, which is important for comparing all the media types and provide room to reflect for the readers after seeing all information. Other small details, like using a dotted arrow and a "P" to distinguish the projected year and matching the annotation color for "pure-play internet" to the line itself, gave the chart good uniformity and consistency.

However, as I critique the visualization thoroughly, I found a lot of elements didn't work well and can be done better to do it's job which is enlighten the audience by delivering exactly what the creator wants to inform. The alignment and margins are a bit off, making the chart "tiring the eyes," and the unaligned annotations distract the reader. The background icons are also distracting and hard to see. More importantly, I have serious concerns about the chart's accuracy; I don't think the graph is proportional to the values on the y-axis (the percentages). The X-axis isn't proportional either, but that's less confusing. The lack of proportionality on the Y-axis is a significant flaw. Furthermore, the meaning of the Y-axis itself is unclear unless you read the title, and the random "50%" dotted mark on the line for Online Ads is completely unexplained. Finally, the color choices, while separating media types, do a poor job of emphasizing the main story of growth and decline, which should be apparent at a glance.

## Step three: Sketch a solution

## Step four: Test the solution

_Before you conduct your interviews, prepare a simple script.  Use this as a guide and as a way to take notes as you go forward. Come up with your own list of questions you want to ask for the selected visualization. Keep the questions broad so you can get the most value out of your feedback. Then, document answers to your questions here._

Questions to ask (modify these for your own interviews): 

- Can you tell me what you think this is?

- Can you describe to me what this is telling you?

- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?

- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?

- Is there anything you would change or do differently?

Results: 

_Don't identify or share personally identifiable information (PII) about the people you spoke to._


| Question | Interview 1 | Interview 2 |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
|          |             |             |
|          |             |             |
|          |             |             |

Synthesis: 

_What patterns in the feedback emerge?  What did you learn from the feedback?  Based on this feedback, come up with what design changes you think might make the most sense in your final redesign._

## Step five: build the solution

_Include and describe your final solution here. It's also a good idea to summarize your thoughts on the process overall. When you're done with the assignment, this page should all the items mentioned in the assignment page on Canvas(a link or screenshot of the original data visualization, documentation explaining your process, a summary of your wireframes and user feedback, your final, redesigned data visualization, etc.)._
