# The Shift to Digital: Redesigning U.S. Ad Spend Visualization

Here, I will conduct a comprehensive critique and redesign of an existing data visualization to enhance the storytelling of the data. I will be using one of the publicly accessible sources from [Makeover Monday](https://makeovermonday.co.uk/).

## Step One: the visualization

Here is the original data visualization I chose to critique and redesign, along with its source.

- Data Visualization Source: [Group M - The Majority of Advertising Dollars are Now Being Spent Online](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/majority-advertising-dollars-spent-online/)
- Dataset Source: [MakeoverMonday](https://data.world/makeovermonday/2020w46)

### Why did I choose this particular data visualization?

I selected this visualization from Visual Capitalist for three key reasons. 

First, as a student invested in the entertainment industry, where marketing is key for any professional, this data caught my attention when I was searching for insights relevant to my career interests. As expected, the advertising market as a whole has increased significantly over the last decade, yet it was fascinated to see such a massive gap in share between digital marketing and traditional physical marketing. Moreover, the consistent decrease in the share of TV advertising over time was a trend I found particularly unexpected and worth exploring further.

Secondly, after reviewing the original dataset (Share of US Ad Spend.xlsx), I noticed that the file contains much more context than the chart currently displays, offering the potential to deliver a more detailed and interesting story. For instance, while the original visualization only focused on the proportional share of advertisement spending, the dataset includes revenues earned and categorizes the media into even more specific segments. 

Lastly, first to insights made me think that this original visualization has much redesign potential. I found that there are many possible ways to remodel the original visualization to better highlight the key story I want to propose, specifically the dramatic shift in dominance, based on the tailored data.

## Step Two: the critique

For step two, I submitted a Google Form, reflecting my initial observations of the original data visualization.

To evaluate the original visualization, the class utilized Stephen Few's Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile and answered several critique questions below.

* Usefulness: 9/10
* Completeness: 7/10
* Perceptibility: 5/10
* Truthfulness: 8/10
* Intuitiveness: 4/10
* Aesthetics: 9/10
* Engagement: 6/10

My overall observation is that this is a data-driven, declarative visualization intended to make a clear statement based on statistics rather than conceptual ideas. In terms of what worked for me, the chart's simplicity stood out first. The title is straightforward, and the high-level contrast between 2012 and 2024 is immediately visible through the height changes of the lines. I also noticed that the creator of this visualization tries to give additional details, such as matching the annotation color for "pure-play internet" to its corresponding line.

However, the visualization has several elements that distract from the chart's ability to deliver key stories to the audience. The alignment and margins are slightly off, and the unaligned annotations create visual clutter tiring the eyes of the readers. Moreover, I was confused about the chart's accuracy and proportions. The Y-axis lacks labels and appears disproportionate to the values it represents, and the "50%" mark on the Online Ads line is not explained at all. While the color choices successfully separate the media types, they fail to emphasize the core narrative of growth versus decline in each medium at first glance.

The primary audience for this visualization will include, but not be limited to, industry professionals—Marketers, Advertisers, and Media Planners—as well as Business Executives. I believe the visualization is only partially effective for this group. While it successfully delivers the high-level story of internet dominance with a simple, straightforward line graph, it lacks the execution required for professionals. It conveys the core message on a surface level, but the technical misses and distracting design elements overall confuse the context that the creator wants to deliver.

I plan to redesign my approach to focus on improving contextual awareness and visual clarity using an entirely different format. While the outcome may or may not improve the context, exploring other options will provide insightful, hands-on learning. The current line chart becomes distracting with over five variables, so switching the visualization format entirely, such as a dumbbell chart, stacked bar chart, or side-by-side bar chart, rather than making minor tweaks, might improve the clarity of the story: the differences in media over time.

I also want to find a more effective way to represent the timeline and clarify the main story's narrative. I can focus on a "2012 vs. 2024" or use a different format to highlight past (2012), current (2020), and projection (2024). In terms of design, I will adopt a more intuitive color palette, such as utilizing grey to de-emphasize non-key variables and highlighting the main story. Finally, I will determine whether the share of spending, the budget itself, or the earnings is the most effective tool for conveying the narrative.

## Step Three: sketch a solution

![IMG_3235](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bf372b82-c106-44f2-ac4b-87005b1f8492)

The focus of my main story in this redesign was to highlight the change in advertising revenue over time for each medium. The original visualization focused on spending share, which I found to be ineffective for our target audience. The ultimate goal of any marketing effort is a positive outcome—specifically earnings or revenue from each advertising method—rather than just spending. Moreover, since the dataset contained revenue figures, I was confused about how the original visualization derived the spending share.

To address the visual clutter and lack of focused storytelling in the original line chart, I sketched a Dumbbell Chart (Paired Bar Chart) as my potential redesign. I also considered using a stacked or side-by-side bar chart for each medium, but I found those designs to be visually too complicated when reflecting multiple time periods. Unlike the original visualization, which forced the reader to track complex, intersecting lines across twelve years, this design isolates the two most important data points: the past (2012) as the baseline for comparison, and the current (2020) as the outcome. This approach allows me to tell a clear "Before and After" story. Another important time period is 2024, which represents the projected revenue. I plan to brainstorm ideas to see if there is a way to incorporate this projection into the visualization as well.

## Step Four: test the solution

_Before you conduct your interviews, prepare a simple script.  Use this as a guide and as a way to take notes as you go forward. Come up with your own list of questions you want to ask for the selected visualization. Keep the questions broad so you can get the most value out of your feedback. Then, document answers to your questions here._

Questions to ask (modify these for your own interviews): 

- Can you tell me what you think this is?

- Can you describe to me what this is telling you?

- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?

- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?

- Is there anything you would change or do differently?

Results: 

_Don't identify or share personally identifiable information (PII) about the people you spoke to._


| Question | Interview 1 | Interview 2 |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
|  What worked?        |             |             |
|          |             |             |
|          |             |             |

Synthesis: 

_What patterns in the feedback emerge?  What did you learn from the feedback?  Based on this feedback, come up with what design changes you think might make the most sense in your final redesign._

## Step Five: build the solution
