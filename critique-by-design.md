# The Shift to Digital: Redesigning U.S. Ad Spend Visualization

Here, I will conduct a comprehensive critique and redesign of an existing data visualization to enhance the storytelling of the data. I will be using one of the publicly accessible sources from [Makeover Monday](https://makeovermonday.co.uk/).

## Step One: The visualization

Here is the original data visualization I chose to critique and redesign, along with its source.

<img width="653" height="656" alt="Screenshot 2025-11-13 at 11 39 43 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e7007ed2-0dec-45f3-bdd4-eca1334996bd" />

- Dataset Source: [MakeoverMonday](https://data.world/makeovermonday/2020w46)

### Why did I choose this particular data visualization?

I selected this visualization from Visual Capitalist for three key reasons. 

First, as a student invested in the entertainment industry, where marketing is key for any professional, this data caught my attention when I was searching for insights relevant to my career interests. As expected, the advertising market as a whole has increased significantly over the last decade, yet it was fascinating to see such a massive gap in share between digital marketing and traditional physical marketing. Moreover, the consistent decrease in the share of TV advertising over time was a trend I found particularly unexpected and worth exploring further.

Secondly, after reviewing the original dataset (Share of US Ad Spend.xlsx), I noticed that the file contains much more context than the chart currently displays, offering the potential to deliver a more detailed and interesting story. For instance, while the original visualization only focused on the proportional share of advertisement spending, the dataset includes revenues earned and categorizes the media into even more specific segments. 

Those insights altogether made me think that this original visualization has much redesign potential. I found that there are many possible ways to remodel the original visualization to better highlight the key story I want to propose, specifically the dramatic shift in dominance, based on the tailored data.

## Step Two: The critique

For step two, I submitted a Google Form, reflecting my initial observations of the original data visualization.

To evaluate the original visualization, the class utilized Stephen Few's Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile and answered several critique questions below.

### Effectiveness Scale

* Usefulness: 9/10
* Completeness: 7/10
* Perceptibility: 5/10
* Truthfulness: 8/10
* Intuitiveness: 4/10
* Aesthetics: 9/10
* Engagement: 6/10

### Analysis & Insights

My overall observation is that this is a data-driven, declarative visualization intended to make a clear statement based on statistics rather than conceptual ideas. In terms of what worked for me, the chart's simplicity stood out first. The title is straightforward, and the high-level contrast between 2012 and 2024 is immediately visible through the height changes of the lines. I also noticed that the creator of this visualization tries to give additional details, such as matching the annotation color for "pure-play internet" to its corresponding line.

However, the visualization has several elements that distract from the chart's ability to deliver key stories to the audience. The alignment and margins are slightly off, and the unaligned annotations create visual clutter, tiring the eyes of the readers. Moreover, I was confused about the chart's accuracy and proportions. The Y-axis lacks labels and appears disproportionate to the values it represents, and the "50%" mark on the Online Ads line is not explained at all. While the color choices successfully separate the media types, they fail to emphasize the core narrative of growth versus decline in each medium at first glance.

The primary audience for this visualization will include, but not be limited to, industry professionals—Marketers, Advertisers, and Media Planners—as well as Business Executives. I believe the visualization is only partially effective for this group. While it successfully delivers the high-level story of internet dominance with a simple, straightforward line graph, it lacks the execution required for professionals. It conveys the core message on a surface level, but the technical misses and distracting design elements overall confuse the context that the creator wants to deliver.

I plan to redesign my approach to focus on improving contextual awareness and visual clarity using an entirely different format. While the outcome may or may not improve the context, exploring other options will provide insightful, hands-on learning. The current line chart becomes distracting with over five variables, so switching the visualization format entirely, such as a dumbbell chart, stacked bar chart, or side-by-side bar chart, rather than making minor tweaks, might improve the clarity of the story: the differences in media over time.

I also want to find a more effective way to represent the timeline and clarify the main story's narrative. I can focus on a "2012 vs. 2024" or use a different format to highlight past (2012), current (2020), and projection (2024). In terms of design, I will adopt a more intuitive color palette, such as utilizing grey to de-emphasize non-key variables and highlighting the main story. Finally, I will determine whether the share of spending, the budget itself, or the earnings is the most effective tool for conveying the narrative.

## Step Three: Sketch a solution

![IMG_3235](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bf372b82-c106-44f2-ac4b-87005b1f8492)

The focus of my main story in this redesign was to highlight the change in advertising revenue over time for each medium. The original visualization focused on the spending share, which I found to be ineffective for our target audience. The ultimate goal of any marketing effort is a positive outcome—earnings or revenue from each advertising method—rather than just spending. Moreover, since the dataset contained revenue figures, I was confused about how the original visualization derived the spending share.

To address the visual clutter and lack of focused storytelling in the original line chart, I sketched a Dumbbell Chart (Paired Bar Chart) as my potential redesign. I also considered using a stacked or side-by-side bar chart for each medium, but I found those designs to be visually too complicated when reflecting multiple time periods. Unlike the original visualization, which forced the reader to track complex, intersecting lines across twelve years, this design isolates the two most important data points: the past (2012) as the baseline for comparison, and the current (2020) as the outcome. This approach allows me to tell a clear "Before and After" story. Another important time period is 2024, which represents the projected revenue. I plan to brainstorm ideas to see if there is a way to incorporate this projection into the visualization as well.

## Step Four: Test the solution

I conducted interviews with two students at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) about my sketch. 

Interview 1 was done with a CMU student, mid-20s, taking the "Telling Stories with Data" course with me. Interview 2 was conducted with another CMU student, early 20s, who has previous marketing internship experience and is currently in the Master of Entertainment Industry Management (MEIM) program.

While I was open to any feedback, my primary focus was to determine if the dumbbell chart format effectively removed the visual clutter I noticed in the original visualization and if the "Before and After" trend was clear to different readers. The only information I provided before showing my sketch is that the data is about marketing revenue and its trend over time. Towards the end of the interview, I showed them the original data visualization and answered any follow-up questions from the interviewees.

### Questions Asked: 

- Tell me what you think this sketch is?

- Can you see the main story/context that I'm trying to propose?

- Is there anything you find interesting, surprising, or confusing?

- Who do you think is the target audience for this sketch?

- Is there anything you would change or do differently?

### Interview Results

| Question | Interview 1 | Interview 2 |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| Can you tell me what you think this is? | It looks like a grouped bar chart (later the person said it's a barbell chart), comparing values across different media categories between two specific years, 2012 and 2020. | A snapshot of the advertising industry share? Or perhaps how much they are making. I think it shows where the money was going from 2012 to 2020 based on the title. |
| Can you see the main story/context that I'm trying to propose? | The story seems like internet advertising is rising drastically over time, while everything else, especially directories and Newspapers, is the least influential platform. The gap between the dots shows the intensity of that change. Yet, it is unclear what exact value the story is trying to tell. | Again, based on the title and the location of each line, it is telling me that traditional marketing channels are old and decreasing. For the marketer, it suggests that they should allocate the budget, which will be spent on the internet and TV, rather than the old marketing tools. |
| Is there anything you find interesting, surprising, or confusing? | The chart type works in a way to compare two different time periods with the circles at both ends of the lines. However, I'm definitely confused about the axis. The sketch says "%" or "$"? at the bottom. Without knowing what the percentage on the x-axis represents, it's difficult to judge the scale, and more importantly, it will not be effective in telling the story. Also, I'm not sure why you only show 2012 and 2020 if the data has 2024 data. It seems to me the projection could tell more interesting insights. | I was surprised by how big a difference the impact of each marketing strategy has. And I like the lines with the two emphases on each year, and how you plan to apply different colors for contrast. The most confusing part is the timeline and the x-axis. The y-axis is clear to understand without any label, but I cannot tell what the x-axis represents. Also, it was difficult to tell what the circles at the end of each line meant. I didn't read the subtitle, and it took me a while to figure it out. Still, it is a cool idea in terms of design. Just clarify better by using maybe legends or text next to the circle. |
| Who do you think is the target audience for this sketch? | Marketing industry professionals or data analysts are trying to apply ad strategies based on the trend. | Business professionals, brand managers, or entertainment executives, etc. People who need to justify why they should invest heavily in the internet and want to find some alternative marketing options. |
| Is there anything you would change or do differently? | Definitely add the 2024 projection if you can. It might make the line wider or have two different charts side-by-side. Still, the 2024 projection will catch more attention than just showing the actual outcomes only. Also, figure out how to make the x-axis clearer because that's where the most ambiguity comes from. Consider adding legends, labels, or a note next to the dots so I don't have to scan down to the axis. | To make the story stronger, I would make the "Internet" line stand out. You already said the "Internet" line will be in red, so that might work. I will also clarify whether you want to use the "%" or "$" for the x-axis and clarify them on the visualization. Additionally, the current chart doesn't indicate which dots represent 2012 and 2020. This is important because it will tell whether there was a decrease or an increase! You can consider adding an arrow or something similar. And maybe sort them by the biggest increase to smallest, or biggest decrease to smallest, to show some uniformity. |

### Synthesizing Feedback

From the feedback from both interviewees, I was able to identify several key insights that were commonly shared. While switching the format to the dumbbell chart format is mostly successful in terms of representing the overall narrative of each advertising platform and its performance review over time, there are many specific details in the sketch that caused confusion for them. First of all, both interviewees struggled to understand the units on the x-axis immediately. They both questioned whether the horizontal scale represents the market share or advertising revenue in percentages. Secondly, they found the timeline of the dots is ambiguous without using features like labeling, annotations, or legends. Lastly, they found that most of the different advertising platforms (including TV, Magazines, and newspapers) provided insightful information, rather than highlighting the Internet (the most significant increase) and Directories (the poorest performance). Overall, the interview taught me that while the visualization format is intuitive and effective for displaying all variables in one chart, it lacks clarity and requires better design improvements and clearer text elements.

Based on the feedback, here are some of the redesign ideas that I am considering to implement:

1. Add 2024 Projection: I will add a third point to the chart (2024 projection) to show the future trajectory on the final visualization.
2. Define the Axis: I will use Revenue ($) rather than percentage share, as this aligns with the needs of the target market to find what the outcome (earnings) is and provide them insights on which medium to use..
3. Visual Improvements: I will consider the minor suggestions in visual elements, such as sorting, removing gray colors, applying legends to clarify the dots, etc.

## Step Five: Build the solution

I used Tableau for building the final visualization. My main goal was to clarify the narrative: the aggressive shift of advertising strategy toward the Internet compared to traditional media. Below are the journey I took, the final visualization, and comments on each step.

<img width="547" height="385" alt="Screenshot 2025-11-14 at 10 08 02 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a8fc85ec-f8de-4032-87a9-dbe210941ccf" />

Before starting the redesign in Tableau, I first took a look at the original dataset, Share of US Ad Spend.xlsx, to understand the variables. I immediately noticed an inconsistency between the dataset and the original visualization, which focuses on Ad Spend Share (%). The raw data values appeared to be monetary amounts. I learned that these values actually represented Media Ad Revenue, not spending, according to the original source mid-year report [^1]. I was planning to redesign the chart, focusing on the revenue (the outcome), so this wasn't an issue, but it was a good note to make.

<img width="557" height="339" alt="Screenshot 2025-11-14 at 10 17 47 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/54755b8e-5733-41b7-9997-21e39e870373" />

After reading the raw dataset, I imported the data into Tableau and changed the variable names ("Year" and "Revenue") for clarity.

<img width="332" height="298" alt="Screenshot 2025-11-14 at 9 46 22 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f3e13b3d-1460-4540-b99f-cc2e9c62107d" />

<img width="356" height="266" alt="Screenshot 2025-11-14 at 10 26 27 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1ef55d45-94e4-41ff-9443-8f78f52cc48f" />

The data was segmented in much detail, containing variables for both "Type" (broad categories like TV) and "Source" (sub-categories like National vs. Local TV). 

The original visualization displayed over eight categories, which felt overwhelming and distracting for the readers. To improve conciseness and visibility, I excluded "Source" variables to focus on the macro trends. The grouping of minor categories, such as "Direct Mail," "Directories," and "Out-of-Home," into a single "Other" category would still display their values, but it doesn't stand out since it doesn't provide much meaningful insight for those platforms.

I also changed "Pure-Play Internet" to simply "Internet" for conciseness. This narrowed the focus to six major media types, letting the viewer not get distracted by minor variables.

<img width="1512" height="943" alt="Screenshot 2025-11-14 at 10 29 56 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4747c43b-466f-4539-a1bf-8e9377985da7" />

Based on the feedback from the interview, I moved forward with the Dumbbell Chart design. I placed "Type" of media on the Y-axis and "Sum(Revenue)" to show the total for each year on the X-axis. This created the horizontal line graph or thin bar graph. Then, I filtered "Year" to make the visualization only contain the data from three key years: 2012 (the past), 2020 (the recent shift), and 2024 (the projection).

<img width="1512" height="941" alt="Screenshot 2025-11-14 at 10 38 39 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ae56aeea-bd8d-4d23-8e07-8586f097f614" />

As shown in the previous step, the challenge I faced during the redesign was determining how to visually represent the three distinct years (2012, 2020, 2024) on the line. While the line is created based on the revenue data from those three years only, it was not showing on the chart, making it impossible for readers to know which year generated how much revenue. 

I applied the technique learned in class, which involves overlapping the exact visualization with different design elements to convey multiple contexts. I created a copy of the chart by duplicating the "SUM(Revenue)" variable in a column, which made exactly the same chart side by side. Then, I changed the design from a line to a circle on the Marks tab to create three dots, representing each year, on the copied chart. 

The color of the lines on the graph's left side changed to red to make the dots visible when two charts are merged.

<img width="967" height="481" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/41af3212-dfdc-47ba-b38d-73117a8d70e9" />

I merged two graphs, showing the same trend line with three dots representing each year. 

<img width="1512" height="943" alt="Screenshot 2025-11-14 at 10 44 37 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/83fc95ec-fdc5-43c2-8862-6cd1cfff39d1" />

<img width="1512" height="942" alt="Screenshot 2025-11-14 at 10 44 32 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c3e2daf9-2f85-4497-a6b2-920a921382d9" />

From here, I explored different style elements to balance the visibility between the connecting lines and the dots. Some of the options include changing the shape and resizing the shapes, as shown above. 

<img width="1512" height="941" alt="Screenshot 2025-11-14 at 10 49 02 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f16a7f45-deaa-4bc1-98c6-75d6a349c52a" />

Another concern was how to tell the readers which dot represents which year. As shown above, notes on each dot were overwhelming in both contextual and design-wise. Based on the feedback, I decided to change the bar to grey, apply different colors over three years, and include legends to explain which year each color represents.

<img width="1512" height="942" alt="Screenshot 2025-11-14 at 10 54 50 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4edb1933-f6b2-400f-a6c1-085636351811" />

After many iterations, I concluded that changing the shape isn't too effective. Keeping the design of the trendline as a straight line with rounded edges, and using a circular dot for the year, was the best option. Therefore, I increased the thickness of each line, representing a bar, and placed circular dots inside the bars. Because some of the values ("Year") were too close to each other on the chart, if I increased the size of the dots alone, they would overlap and not be distinguishable from one another. This allowed me to create thick grey bars to represent the path and overlay distinct circles for the specific years.

Lastly, I made the final minor modifications, such as removing the x-axis label at the top and adding a clear and engaging title. Additionally, I sorted the order to align the media types on the Y-axis by 2024 Revenue (from High to Low). So, the visualization places "Internet" at the very top, intuitively expressing its dominance.

  vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);                
</script>

The result is a clear, data-driven narrative that engages the audience about the massive revenue gap between digital and traditional media, without the clutter of the original line chart.
