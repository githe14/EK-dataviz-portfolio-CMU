# Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU!  Here's where all my cool work will go.  You should probably hire me. 

# About me
Hello! My name is Eddie K (he/him/his), and I’m a graduate student in the Master of Entertainment Industry Management (MEIM) program at Carnegie Mellon University. I joined this program to build on my business experience while developing new skills at the intersection of creativity, technology, and data.

With a background in business management—particularly strategy and consulting—I’m passionate about using data to uncover hidden stories and deliver insights that drive strategic decisions. I’m now channeling this passion into a career in the entertainment industry, with a specific focus on the music sector. My interests center on strategy and development, data analytics, and artist development (A&R), where I see data-driven decision-making is becoming increasingly vital and profitable (surprise!).

This portfolio serves as my workshop for both coursework (*Telling Stories with Data*) and future professional opportunities. I’ll explore and showcase data visualization projects here with the goal of translating complex data into clear, actionable, and compelling narratives that inform real-world business strategies.

# What I hope to learn
I'm here to build the fundamental skills in data visualization that can be applied to my career using the the real-world data. My "About Me" section states my goal is to **"translate complex data into 'clear, actionable, and compelling narratives' for the music industry."** This course, *Telling Stories with Data*, is where I plan to learn exactly how to do that by focusing on several key areas:

**1. Understanding Context First:** Before I even start to build a visualization, I want to get better at understanding the full context of the data. Throughout my professional experiences, I learned how important it is to find the "what" and "why." So, my first area to learn will be successfully understanding the message within the data.

**2. Selecting the Right Tools Strategically:** I want to move beyond just knowing what tool, like Tableau, to use and learn how to strategically select the right tool, right visualization, and the right design (like color, layout, and chart type) for a specific target audience. Any strategy is useless if it's not clear.

**3. Learning to Reflect and Critique:** I plan to learn successfully from reflection and critique. Developing the ability to analyze the work of my own and others and how to justify why they are effective or not will provide deeper insights that are different from simply creating the visualization.

**4. Applying Learning to Real-World:** Finally, this portfolio is my space to explore, practice, and showcase this entire workflow. My ultimate goal is to use the all assignments, activities, and fianl project to simulate a real-world music industry scenario. I hope to take a complex dataset and build a narrative that could successfully provide insights and strategic solutions to my field of interst (entertainmen & music). This is how I'll build the proof that I can be that data-driven storyteller.

# Examples
You can keep this section for stuff from in-class demos or your other work, or remove it. 

## Assignment: [Visualizing overnment Debt](visualizing-government-debt)
For this assignment, make sure you set up and link to a new page.  This page is linking to a new Markdown document called `visualizing-government-debt.md`.  For links to Markdown files in your repository, you can just include the name of the page without the `.md` extension. 

## Assignment 3&4: [Critique by Design](critique-by-design)
For this assignment, make sure you set up and link to a new page.  This page is linking to a new Markdown document called `critique-by-design.md`.  

## Final project
Here it might be helpful to include a high-level description of your final project.

## Other stuff you can do (you can remove this section - it's just for your reference.)

### Changing text

You can change text, like this: 

**Here's some bold** text.  Here's some *italic* text. Here's some ~~strikethrough~~ text. 

### Creating tables

You can build tables like this: 

| Name         | Type of pet | Favority activity 1 | FA 2   | FA 3            | FA 4                                |
|--------------|-------------|---------------------|--------|-----------------|-------------------------------------|
| Eli          | cat         | Sleeping            | Eating | Being pet       | Plotting to overthow dog empire     |
| Howard       | dog         | You                 | You    | You             | Eating                              |
| Frankenstein | fish        | Swimming            | Eating | Blowing bubbles | Forgetting                          |

An easy-to-use template generator tool [can be found here](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables)

You can use different headings, like this: 

# Here's a large title (H1)
## Here's a subtitle (H2)
### ...and so on (H3)
You get the idea - just don't forget the space between the # and your title.  `#Title` won't work, but `# Title` will. 

### Adding images

Here's an example of how to add an image to my portfolio.  

![funny dog picture](funny-dog-unsplash.jpg)
> Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/pt-br/@charlesdeluvio?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText">charlesdeluvio</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/K4mSJ7kc0As?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a>
  

Alternately, you can set the size of the image using just a bit of HTML: 

<img src="funny-dog-unsplash.jpg" width="200"/>

Remember that you'll need to upload the image into your repository, or include a link to the image somewhere else.  

### Setting up a separate page

So here's the code you'll need to add to your own site to create a second page. 

1. First, create a new page in your repository (for example, dataviz1.md)
2. Next, add a link to that page by inserting the following into your readme.md page:

`[title](dataviz)` or `[dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)` or `[CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)`

Any of those formats will work. Here's some examples of working links: 

`[title](dataviz)` = [title](dataviz)  
`[dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)` = [dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)  
`[CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)` = [CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)   

Make sure to check these from your publicly accessible URL to make sure they're working correctly (not from the preview tab).
